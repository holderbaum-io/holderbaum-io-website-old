title: 'The /mentoring Programme'
---

I am very inspired by the idea behind
[/mentoring](https://github.com/dianakimball/mentoring).
And so I grabbed the template and adapted:

Every major step forward in my life so far has been inspired and encouraged by
the mentors I’ve been fortunate enough to have. I believe that hopes, dreams,
and advice are best shared in ongoing, personal relationships, and it’s
important to me to make myself available as a mentor to others.

I’ve had so many great experiences in my life, and I’d love to share them if
you’re considering pursuing a similar path:

I spent a few years with hands-on planning, designing and implementing large
scaled server applications, using different agile methodologies. This helped me
accumulate a certain amount of experiences around TDD and general test-first
approaches. I also earned a Masters degree in hardware engineering and got my
hands dirty on test first methodologies for embedded software in C.

If you’d like to work together, you can write me a letter responding to the
questions below; I’ll write back to all letters I receive in this way within a
week no matter what. In response to the most exceptional letters, I’ll propose
further correspondence -- and in certain cases, an ongoing mentoring
relationship.

* Tell me about yourself. How did you become who you are, and who do you want to
  become?
* What do you hope to gain from our mentoring relationship?
* What’s the best thing you’ve read, watched, or listened to lately?

Add links to any profiles or projects you’re proud of, and send it all to my
[mail address](mailto:blog@jakob.io).

I look forward to learning together!
