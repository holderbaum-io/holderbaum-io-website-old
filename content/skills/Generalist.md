Throughout the years I have developed software in many a different industries.

From **large scale mobile browser games** entertaining millions of users over
**security critical cloud based IoT platforms** connecting machines all over
the world to **safety critical bootloaders for microcontrollers** ensuring
correct behaviour of everyday devices. Exploring similarities and differences
of the challenges posed by a diverse range of products is helping me to become
the generalist I am today.
