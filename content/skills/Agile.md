I love pairing and any form of social interaction.  Working as a **coach and
mentor** gives me a lot of pleasure and I really enjoy teaching things Iâ€™ve
learned.  I spend a lot of time with **continuously delivering** high-level
software systems and low-level embedded systems using **test-first
methodologies**.
