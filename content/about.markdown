My name is Jakob.
I am really curious about
software,
security,
free and open source software,
and teaching.

I work at [ThoughtWorks][thought]
as Software Developer and Consultant.
At ThoughtWorks we try
to make the world a better place
using advanced
technologies and methodologies.

## How I work

I love pairing
and any form of social interaction.
Working as a coach and mentor
gives me a lot of pleasure
and I really enjoy
teaching things I've learned.

Make sure to check out [this link](/mentoring.html).

I spend a lot of time
with continuously delivering
high-level software systems
and low-level embedded systems
using test-first methodologies.

## How I spend my free time

When I am not crafting,
I often spend my time reading books,
traveling around,
learning new paradigms and programming languages
or doing outdoor sports.
