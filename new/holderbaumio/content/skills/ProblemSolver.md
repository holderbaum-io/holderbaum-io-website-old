I love pairing and any form of social interaction. Working as a coach and
mentor gives me a lot of pleasure and I really enjoy teaching things Iâ€™ve
learned. I spend a lot of time with continuously delivering high-level software
systems and low-level embedded systems using test-first methodologies.
